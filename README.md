This is a K-Pop Survival Show (?)/ Member Picker.

With the app, you can pick which person you'd like to see in a K-pop group together. Out of the people shown, you have to pick five people you want to see in the group.
When you pick someone, the card with their picture and thier name border turns to a bolder black and the background turns gray. The picture is then added to a bottom div where people can easily view their picks.
When you hover over the cards, the backgrounds are also gray.

The user is also prompted to provide a name for the group. The name for the group cannot have any special characters.
If the input field is blank and the user hits submit, they're forced to enter a name that's at least 4 characters long.

If the user hits submit, and they haven't selected five members yet, they're prompted immediately to select more members.
Users are unable to select more people after five people are added to their pick list.
Users can select and unselect people which will be reflected in their pick list.

Once the user has chosen a name and picked five people, they're asked to confirm that they're happy with their choice of name and the members of the group.
If the user hits cancel, they're brought back to their screen to make changes.
If the user hits ok, the screen is cleared and they can do it over again.
